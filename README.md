## 🔬 Technical Deep Dive

### What AutoSei Does

AutoSei is an AI-powered DeFi portfolio manager on the Sei EVM network. Through one conversational interface, users can:

#### 📊 **Allocate & Rebalance**
AI-driven portfolio weights (w_i) across 7 asset classes by solving the portfolio optimization problem:

$$\max_{w_i} \left( \sum_i w_i \mathbb{E}[r_i] - \lambda \sum_{i,j} w_i w_j \sigma_{ij} \right) \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \sum_i w_i = 1$$

Where:
- $w_i$ = weight allocation for asset class $i$
- $\mathbb{E}[r_i]$ = expected return for asset $i$ 
- $\lambda$ = risk aversion parameter
- $\sigma_{ij}$ = covariance between assets $i$ and $j$
- Subject to the constraint that all weights sum to 1

This optimization balances expected returns against portfolio risk, with AI dynamically adjusting the risk parameter $\lambda$ based on market conditions and user preferences.

#### 🤖 **Deploy Trading Bots**
Six sophisticated strategies with ML-powered entry/exit signals:
- **Momentum Trading**: Trend-following algorithms with technical indicators
- **Mean Reversion**: Statistical arbitrage on price deviations
- **Arbitrage Bots**: Cross-DEX price difference exploitation
- **Grid Trading**: Systematic buy/sell orders in price ranges
- **DCA Strategies**: Dollar-cost averaging with AI timing optimization
- **Yield Farming**: Automated liquidity provision and reward harvesting

#### 🐋 **Track Whale Activity**
Advanced transaction monitoring system:
- **Deep Scanner**: Analyze up to 1,000 recent transactions per token
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Set alerts from $10K to $1M+ transaction values
- **AI-Powered Alerts**: Predictive insights on market-moving whale activities
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify accumulation/distribution patterns

#### 💰 **Optimize Yields**
Real-time yield comparison and optimization:
- **Protocol APY Monitoring**: Live tracking across major DeFi protocols
- **Automated Fund Routing**: Dynamic reallocation to highest-yield opportunities
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Balance yield optimization with risk management
- **Gas Cost Analysis**: Factor transaction costs into yield calculations

#### 🗣️ **Natural Language Interface**
