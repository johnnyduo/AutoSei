# AutoSei Contract Integration Summary

## Deployed Contract Addresses

### Production Contracts on Sei EVM Testnet

1. **AutoSeiPortfolio** (Full Contract)
   - Address: `0xF76Bb2A92d288f15bF17C405Ae715f8d1cedB058`
   - Features: Complete portfolio management with AI signals, trading bots, whale tracking
   - Used for: Advanced features requiring full functionality

2. **AutoSeiPortfolioCore** (Core Contract)
   - Address: `0x2921dbEd807E9ADfF57885a6666d82d6e6596AC2`
   - Features: Essential portfolio management functions
   - Used for: Basic allocation updates, user registration, portfolio summaries

## Environment Configuration

The `.env` file has been updated with the deployed contract addresses:

```env
# Contract Configuration - Deployed on Sei EVM Testnet
VITE_PORTFOLIO_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x2921dbEd807E9ADfF57885a6666d82d6e6596AC2
VITE_PORTFOLIO_FULL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xF76Bb2A92d288f15bF17C405Ae715f8d1cedB058
```

## Contract Service Architecture

### Smart Contract Selection
The contract service now automatically selects the appropriate contract based on the feature being used:

- **Basic Operations** → Core Contract (`AutoSeiPortfolioCore`)
  - User registration
  - Portfolio allocation updates
  - Portfolio summary retrieval
  - Basic user management

- **Advanced Operations** → Full Contract (`AutoSeiPortfolio`)
  - AI signal management
  - Trading bot operations
  - Whale activity tracking
  - Advanced analytics

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Dual Contract Support**: The system seamlessly switches between contracts based on functionality requirements
2. **Automatic Contract Selection**: The `getContractConfig()` function automatically chooses the right contract
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: If one contract fails, the system can gracefully handle errors
4. **Contract Validation**: Built-in validation to ensure contract addresses are properly configured

### Updated Functions

All contract interaction functions have been updated to use the new dual-contract architecture:

- `updateAllocations()` - Uses core contract for basic allocation updates
- `usePortfolioAllocations()` - Uses core contract for reading allocations
- `useAISignals()` - Uses full contract for AI signal data
- `useActiveTradingBots()` - Uses full contract for trading bot information
- `useWhaleActivities()` - Uses full contract for whale tracking data
- `usePortfolioSummary()` - Uses core contract for portfolio summaries

## ABI Configuration

Both contract ABIs are properly imported and configured:

```typescript
import AutoSeiPortfolioCoreABI from '../abi/AutoSeiPortfolioCore.json';
import AutoSeiPortfolioABI from '../abi/AutoSeiPortfolio.json';
```

## Build Status

✅ **Build Successful**: The project builds without errors
✅ **Contract Integration**: Both contracts are properly integrated
✅ **Environment Configuration**: Contract addresses are correctly configured
✅ **Type Safety**: All TypeScript interfaces are properly defined

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Functions**: Test user registration and allocation updates using the core contract
2. **Advanced Functions**: Test AI signals and trading bots using the full contract
3. **Error Handling**: Verify graceful handling of contract interaction failures
4. **Gas Optimization**: Monitor gas usage for different contract operations

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Testing**: Test all components that interact with the contracts
2. **User Registration**: Verify the user registration flow works correctly
3. **Allocation Updates**: Test the portfolio allocation update functionality
4. **AI Features**: Test AI signal display and trading bot information
5. **Whale Tracking**: Verify whale activity tracking functionality

## Contract Monitoring

The system includes built-in logging for contract operations:
- Contract address validation
- Transaction monitoring
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics

## Security Considerations

1. **Address Validation**: Contract addresses are validated before use
2. **Owner Checks**: Only contract owners can perform administrative functions
3. **Gas Limits**: Gas limits are set for all transactions
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for failed transactions

This integration provides a robust foundation for the AutoSei platform with both basic and advanced portfolio management capabilities running on the Sei EVM testnet.
