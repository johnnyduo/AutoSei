# Theme Toggle Border Consistency Fix

## Issue Identified
The theme toggle button in the navigation bar had inconsistent border styling compared to feature cards throughout the application.

## Root Cause
- Theme toggle button was using `border-primary/20` for its border color
- Feature cards and other UI elements were using `border-border` (theme-aware border)
- This created visual inconsistency between components

## Solution Applied
Updated the `ThemeToggle.tsx` component to use consistent border styling:

### Changes Made:
1. **Server-side rendered state**: Changed from `border-primary/20` to `border-border`
2. **Interactive state**: Changed from `border-primary/20` to `border-border`
3. **Maintained hover state**: Kept `hover:border-primary/40` for interactive feedback

### Technical Details:
- **File**: `/src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx`
- **Change**: Replaced `border border-primary/20` with `border border-border`
- **Impact**: All theme toggle buttons now match the border color of feature cards
- **Theme Support**: Works correctly in both light and dark modes

## Border Color Values:
- **Light mode**: `--border: 14 20% 85%` (subtle gray)
- **Dark mode**: `--border: 222 47% 20%` (darker gray)

## Result:
- ✅ Theme toggle button now has consistent border color with feature cards
- ✅ Visual harmony maintained across all UI components
- ✅ Professional, cohesive design in both light and dark modes
- ✅ Build successful with no errors

## Status: Complete
This fix ensures complete border consistency across the application's UI components.
